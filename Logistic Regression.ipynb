In machine learning, this is called a binary classification problem: we wish to predict the probability for a binary class (yes or no cancer, 1 or 0).\n",

    "#### 1.2: Activation Function <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1.2\"></a>\n",

This error, depends on the difference between our predicted outcome and the expected outcome, and can be defined as a function called the loss function or cost function. The smaller our loss function, the better our model is doing. In your AP Statistics class you may have learned about least squared error ($\\sum (p - y)^2$), which is indeed a type of loss function, but it's typically used in another type of task in machine learning called regression.

    "In order for our model to be able to \"intellegently\" deal with any input we give it, it needs to train on large amounts of diverse data.

For example, here is what UCI's breast cancer dataset:\n",

    "Here are the steps of a bare-bones gradient descent algorithm:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify $\\theta$ by performing vector addition with $-\\nabla J({\\theta}_t)$ multiplied by a constant, $\\eta$, which is called the learning rate. More formally, ${\\theta}_{t+1} = {\\theta}_t - {\\eta} \\cdot \\nabla J({\\theta}_t)$\n",

    "As part of my project, I also made a visualization of the gradient descent algorithm on an interactive 3D graph. The user can customize the graph by entering their own equation for the function $f(x, y)$, the maximum and minimum values of the function, as well as the learning rate $\\eta$. After graphing, a visual similar to that in section 2.3 will be displayed, where vectors scaled to the magnitude of each step taken in gradient descent will be shown on the 3D graph. The user can use their cursor to rotate the graph, zoom in and out (by scrolling), pan the graph, take a screenshot, and play around with different camera angles. The minimum value found by gradient descent by also be displayed at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my simulation, I employed in the idea in section 2.4, utilizing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\eta}_{t+1} = {\\eta}_{t} \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^{a}} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "to reduce the learning rate overtime. $a$ is a constant that I experimentally found to be optimal at around ~$0.3$. This exact formula is inspired by [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), a meta-heuristic for optimization problems whose core idea is quite similar to gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the global minimum, I also generated many random points to maximize the chance of finding a global minimum on one of them, as in section 2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually build the graph itself, I utilized the plotly graphing library, computing many disjoint points on a 2D meshgrid, then connecting them to form the 3D graph. The core idea is that of [Riemann Sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum), but extended to three dimensions, and rather than finding the area, we're connecting points to build a visualization. As a consequence of this method of generating the graph, 1) the global minimum found may be off by a tiny amount (as the actual minimum can only be achieved iff it is one of the points computed) and 2) the visualization struggles with graphs with a large domain because it'll have to compute quadratically more points, so the max and min are capped (note however that the gradient descent algorithm could perfectly handle a larger domain, as it does for real machine learning loss function such as the one it faces in this notebook's breast cancer dataset)."
